## Terminology

- **Catalog**: An entity that represents information about the clientâ€™s products.
- **Vertical**: Type of the products in the catalog (e.g., fashion, home, general).
- **Indexing Process**: An offline process that can be run on the catalog.

## Features

Users can perform the following actions through the dashboard:

- **View Catalogs**: Display a list of catalogs in a table format, showing the name, vertical, primary status, and last indexed time.
- **Add New Catalog**: Create a new catalog by specifying its name, vertical, and primary status. If a primary catalog already exists for the same vertical, it will be switched to non-primary.
- **Update Catalog**: Modify the primary status of an existing catalog.
- **Delete Catalog**: Remove a catalog from the list. (Bonus: Support for bulk deletion of multiple catalogs.)
- **Indexing Process**: Start the indexing process manually or automatically every 24 hours, with real-time status updates.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: TypeScript (NestJS framework)
- **Frontend**: TypeScript + React
- **Database**: MongoDB
